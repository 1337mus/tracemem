# TraceMem

TraceMem searches past conversations and returns the original messages, with
citations. The research goal is to train a small model to extract useful facts
and decisions without losing who said them, when they applied, or how certain
the speaker was.

Someone might say, “I might try SQLite,” then later, “I chose SQLite.” A memory
system must preserve that difference and point back to both messages. The
current tool finds the source; interpreting the change remains experimental.

**The local search tool works today. A fiction-only SFT pilot has trained an
adapter, but no model has been validated or selected for product use.**

The [SFT pilot report](docs/sft-pilot-results.md) records the completed run and
its zero exact claim matches on eight fictional development prompts. The run
tests the training path; it does not establish model quality or production
readiness.

## What works

- Read-only Claude Code and Codex transcript adapters, plus an explicit
  ChatGPT JSON export reader.
- SQLite keeps speaker roles, text versions, and source locations.
- Keyword search (BM25), vector search, or a combination. Default vectors are
  deterministic and need no model download.
- Complete passages keep their citations when packed for a consumer.

## Evidence flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  CK[Context Kit discovery and configuration] --> A[Read-only source adapters]
  T[Claude Code and Codex transcripts] --> A
  G[Explicit ChatGPT exports] --> A
  A --> E[Saved messages in SQLite]
  E --> S[Search original messages]
  S --> P[Budgeted passages with citations]
  P --> O[Optional answering model]
  E -.-> X[Small model proposes memories]
  X -.-> C[Check format, source quotes, and roles]
  C -.-> L[Save proposed memories and their history]
  L -.-> R[Review their meaning]
```

The solid arrows show local search; the dotted arrows show model experiments.
Context Kit helps locate sources and stays unchanged. Citations let someone
check the original words; a claim may still be wrong. Proposed memories are
kept for review and do not feed search yet.

## Run the synthetic demo

Python 3.11+ and SQLite with FTS5 are enough. The demo and benchmark use
fictional data and run without an API key or model download.

The demo asks “Where is the quarterly planning meeting?” and retrieves “The
quarterly planning session is in room Juniper, on the fourth floor.” with its
source citation.

```sh
make demo
make benchmark
```

To ingest a local transcript and search its evidence, use a private database
path such as `.local/evidence.sqlite3`:

```sh
mkdir -p .local
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m tracemem ingest \
  --provider codex --input /path/to/session.jsonl --db .local/evidence.sqlite3
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m tracemem search \
  --db .local/evidence.sqlite3 --query "What did we decide?" --mode hybrid
```

Keep private source data and derived evidence local. See [data governance](docs/data-governance.md)
for handling rules.
